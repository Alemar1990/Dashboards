A dashboard is an information management tool that visually monitors, analyzes and displays key performance indicators (KPIs), metrics and fundamental data to track the status of a company, a department, a campaign or a process specific.

A dashboard is a kind of "summary" that collects data from different sources in one place and presents it in a digestible way so that the most important thing stands out.
